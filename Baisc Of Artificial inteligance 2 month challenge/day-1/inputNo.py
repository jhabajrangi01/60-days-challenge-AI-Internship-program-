#Question :- Take two numbers as input from the user and print their sum, difference, product, division.
a = int(input("Enter first number = ")) #using type casting
b = int(input("Enter second number = "))

#Sum of two number
sum = a + b
print("Sum of a and b = ",sum)

#difference between two number
diff = a - b
print("difference between a and b = ",diff)

#product of two number
prod = a * b
print("product of a and b = ", prod)

#divison between two number
div = a / b
print("Divison of a and b = ",div)

#Output
